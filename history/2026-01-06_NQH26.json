    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bullish based on previous day (Bullish), Asia (Bullish), and London (Bearish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is small down. HTF slope bias is Neutral. Day type is Normal. Regime is Mixed / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.000, RVOL at 0.64. Kalman slope at 0.8588. Bayes prob 0.73 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Price stretched far from anchored VWAP: mean-revert risk higher. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. AMD signal favors bullish distribution; London close inside. Patterns aligned with other confluences and tilted the bias. HTF zones suggest Bullish bias (score 4.70; Bullish zones: 12, Bearish zones: 8.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is above both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bullish posture). Suggestion: If price opens above daily VWAP, then a retracement to daily VWAP is the first check; if it holds, then continuation can push away from weekly VWAP support. If price opens below daily VWAP, then expect a deeper pullback toward weekly VWAP.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",
