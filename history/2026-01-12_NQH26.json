    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bullish based on previous day (Bullish), Asia (Bearish), and London (Bullish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is large down. HTF slope bias is Neutral. Day type is Chop. Regime is MeanRevert / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'compressed', momentum and ROC aligned at 0.000, RVOL at 0.80. Kalman slope at -0.5043. Bayes prob 0.56 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Large opening gap reduces the odds of an immediate fade. Chop day detected: bias kept but confidence reduced. Mean-revert regime: fade risk higher on extremes. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. AMD signal favors bullish distribution; London close outsidehigh. HTF zones suggest Bearish bias (score -4.60; Bullish zones: 19, Bearish zones: 23.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is below both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bearish posture). Suggestion: watch for a retracement up to daily/weekly VWAP and look for rejection; if price opens and holds below, favor bearish continuation and a push down through the next VWAP line.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",
