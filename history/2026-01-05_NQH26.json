    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bullish based on previous day (Bearish), Asia (Bullish), and London (Bullish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Above. Gap is small up. HTF slope bias is Bullish. Day type is Chop. Regime is MeanRevert / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'compressed', momentum and ROC aligned at 0.001, RVOL at 1.03. Kalman slope at 0.1470. Bayes prob 0.79 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open above overnight range favors trend continuation. HTF slope alignment supports follow-through; conflict adds chop risk. Chop day detected: bias kept but confidence reduced. Mean-revert regime: fade risk higher on extremes. Price stretched far from anchored VWAP: mean-revert risk higher. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. HTF zones suggest Bullish bias (score 2.90; Bullish zones: 17, Bearish zones: 13.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is above both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bullish posture). Suggestion: If price opens above daily VWAP, then a retracement to daily VWAP is the first check; if it holds, then continuation can push away from weekly VWAP support. If price opens below daily VWAP, then expect a deeper pullback toward weekly VWAP.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",

If price opens below daily VWAP, then expect a deeper pullback toward weekly VWAP."
