    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bearish based on previous day (Bearish), Asia (Bearish), and London (Bullish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is small up. HTF slope bias is n/a. Day type is Normal. Regime is Mixed / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'expanded', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.001, RVOL at 1.06. Kalman slope at -0.7030. Bayes prob 0.43 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. AMD signal favors bullish distribution; London close inside. Daily bias not finalized until 10:45 ET (60m OR pending). Patterns aligned with other confluences and tilted the bias. HTF zones suggest Bearish bias (score -11.20; Bullish zones: 8, Bearish zones: 19.).",
