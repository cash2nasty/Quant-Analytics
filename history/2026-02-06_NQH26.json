    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bullish based on previous day (Bearish), Asia (Bullish), and London (Bullish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is small down. HTF slope bias is n/a. Day type is Normal. Regime is Mixed / HMM MeanRevert. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.002, RVOL at 0.26. Kalman slope at 3.8012. Bayes prob 0.68 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. Daily bias confirmed after 10:45 ET by 60m OR (bullish). HMM regime detected: meanrevert state active. HTF zones suggest Bullish bias (score 1.90; Bullish zones: 4, Bearish zones: 3.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is above both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bullish posture). Suggestion: watch for a retracement to daily/weekly VWAP and look for a hold; if price opens and holds above, favor bullish continuation and a push through the next VWAP line.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",
