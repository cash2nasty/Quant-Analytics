    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bearish based on previous day (Bullish), Asia (Bullish), and London (Bearish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bearish (30m) / Bearish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is small up. HTF slope bias is n/a. Day type is Normal. Regime is Mixed / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.001, RVOL at 0.23. Kalman slope at 0.2441. Bayes prob 0.38 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. AMD signal favors bullish distribution; London close inside. HTF zones suggest Bullish bias (score 7.70; Bullish zones: 44, Bearish zones: 37.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is below both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bearish posture). Suggestion: watch for a retracement up to daily/weekly VWAP and look for rejection; if price opens and holds below, favor bearish continuation and a push down through the next VWAP line.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",
