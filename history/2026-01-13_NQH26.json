    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bullish based on previous day (Bullish), Asia (Bullish), and London (Bearish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Above. Gap is small down. HTF slope bias is Neutral. Day type is Chop. Regime is Mixed / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.001, RVOL at 1.15. Kalman slope at -0.0546. Bayes prob 0.56 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open above overnight range favors trend continuation. Chop day detected: bias kept but confidence reduced. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. AMD signal favors bearish distribution; London close inside. HTF zones suggest Bearish bias (score -2.80; Bullish zones: 37, Bearish zones: 41.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is below both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bearish posture). Suggestion: watch for a retracement up to daily/weekly VWAP and look for rejection; if price opens and holds below, favor bearish continuation and a push down through the next VWAP line.",
