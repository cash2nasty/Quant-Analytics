Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is small down. HTF slope bias is Bearish. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at 0.002, RVOL at 0.34. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. HTF slope alignment supports follow-through; conflict adds chop risk.",
