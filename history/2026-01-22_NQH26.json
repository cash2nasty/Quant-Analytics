    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bullish based on previous day (Bullish), Asia (Bearish), and London (Bullish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bullish (30m) / Bullish (60m). Overnight range position is Above. Gap is small up. HTF slope bias is Neutral. Day type is Chop. Regime is MeanRevert / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'compressed', momentum and ROC aligned at 0.000, RVOL at 0.92. Kalman slope at 0.5004. Bayes prob 0.75 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open above overnight range favors trend continuation. Chop day detected: bias kept but confidence reduced. Mean-revert regime: fade risk higher on extremes. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. HTF zones suggest Bearish bias (score -4.60; Bullish zones: 12, Bearish zones: 17.).",
