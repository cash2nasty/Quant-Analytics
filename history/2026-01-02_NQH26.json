    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bearish based on previous day (Neutral), Asia (Bullish), and London (Bullish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bearish (30m) / Bearish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is n/a. HTF slope bias is n/a. Day type is Normal. Regime is Mixed / HMM MeanRevert. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.001, RVOL at 0.13. Kalman slope at -1.7120. Bayes prob 0.32 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Price stretched far from anchored VWAP: mean-revert risk higher. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. Daily bias confirmed after 10:45 ET by 60m OR (bearish). Patterns aligned with other confluences and tilted the bias. HMM regime detected: meanrevert state active.",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is below both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bearish posture). Suggestion: If price opens below daily VWAP, then a retracement up to daily VWAP is the first check; if it rejects, then continuation can push away from weekly VWAP resistance. If price opens above daily VWAP, then expect a deeper pullback toward weekly VWAP.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",
