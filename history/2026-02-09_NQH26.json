    "explanation": "Daily Bias is Bearish based on previous day (Bullish), Asia (Bearish), and London (Bearish) with bayesian equal-weight update. US Open Bias is Bearish (30m) / Bearish (60m). Overnight range position is Inside. Gap is small up. HTF slope bias is Neutral. Day type is Chop. Regime is Mixed / HMM Mixed. Event risk is none. Volatility regime is 'normal', momentum and ROC aligned at -0.001, RVOL at 0.76. Kalman slope at 0.8986. Bayes prob 0.44 from equal weights. News tone is neutral and only adjusts confidence, not direction. Day impact: Session weighting favors larger-range sessions over quieter ones. ATR-scaled thresholds reduce false bias on quiet days. US open inside overnight range favors mean reversion early. Chop day detected: bias kept but confidence reduced. Anchored VWAP aligned with daily bias for fair-value context. Price stretched far from anchored VWAP: mean-revert risk higher. Premarket bias (09:10 ET) uses overnight range, gap, VWAP, and premarket trend. Daily bias confirmed after 10:45 ET by 60m OR (bullish). HTF zones suggest Bullish bias (score 7.50; Bullish zones: 7, Bearish zones: 0.).",
    "vwap_comment": "Price is above both daily and weekly VWAP (strong bullish posture). Suggestion: If price opens above daily VWAP, then a retracement to daily VWAP is the first check; if it holds, then continuation can push away from weekly VWAP support. If price opens below daily VWAP, then expect a deeper pullback toward weekly VWAP.",
    "news_comment": "ForexFactory: neutral (No major high-impact events dominating today's tone.) | SeekingAlpha: neutral (Macro commentary is mixed; no strong risk-on/off consensus.). News tone adjusts bias confidence but does not override session structure.",

If price opens below daily VWAP, then expect a deeper pullback toward weekly VWAP."
